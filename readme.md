# Rust Learning Journey

Welcome to my Rust learning journey! This repository documents my progress as I explore Rust, from the basics to advanced concepts.

## Why Rust?
Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Itâ€™s known for its powerful features like memory safety without a garbage collector, zero-cost abstractions, and fearless concurrency.

## Learning Goals
1. **Basics**: 
    - Variables and Mutability
    - Data Types
    - Functions
    - Control Flow

2. **Intermediate**:
    - Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes
    - Structs and Enums
    - Pattern Matching
    - Collections

3. **Advanced**:
    - Traits and Generics
    - Error Handling
    - Concurrency
    - Unsafe Rust
