# 🏰 Rust Adventure: The Kingdom of Variables & Data Types 🏰

## Welcome to the Kingdom of Rustoria, where every knight, wizard, and merchant must declare their values correctly to maintain peace! Your mission is to help the kingdom manage its resources using Rust variables and data types.

---

# 🛡 Quest 1: The Gold Vault Security
## 💰 The King of Rustoria needs a secure vault to store the kingdom’s gold.

Create a constant GOLD_RESERVE that holds 10,000 gold coins.  

Print the gold reserve using println!().  

💡 Hint: Use const for fixed values and specify the type (u32 for unsigned integers).

---

# 🏹 Quest 2: The Warrior's Training
## ⚔️ The knights of Rustoria need training! A warrior starts with 100 health points, but after training, they gain extra stamina.

Declare an immutable variable health with an initial value of 100.  

Declare a mutable variable stamina with a value of 50 and increase it by 10.  

💡 Hint: Use mut for values that change. Try printing the stamina before and after training.

---

# 🏰 Quest 3: The Wizard’s Spellbook
## 🧙‍♂️ The Royal Wizard needs a special magic rune with the letter 'R' and a true/false flag to check if a spell is active.

Create a char variable for the rune.

Create a bool variable is_spell_active and set it to true.

Print both values with println!().

# 🎯 Final Challenge: Write a Story in Rust!
Combine all the quests into a Rust program that tells a story about the Kingdom of Rustoria, printing values dynamically!

# 📜 Example Output:
```rust
The kingdom has 10,000 gold coins in the vault.  
A brave warrior has 100 health and 60 stamina after training.  
The wizard casts a spell using rune 'R'... Spell active: true!  
The merchant sells 50 swords for 12.99 RustCoins each, earning a total of 649.5 RustCoins!  

```

# 🚀 Bonus Challenge: The Merchant's Tax Calculation
## 🛒 A merchant sells 50 swords for 12.99 RustCoins each.

Create an i32 variable for the number of swords.

Create a f64 variable for the price per sword.

Calculate the total price and print it.

💡 Hint: Multiply an i32 and f64 carefully! You may need type conversion.
