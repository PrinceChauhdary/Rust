# ü¶Ä Lesson 1: Hello, World! in Rust

## üìñ Introduction
Rust programs start with the `main` function. The simplest Rust program prints `"Hello, World!"` to the console.

## üìù Code Example
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```
##  Run the program:

rustc hello.rs <br>
./hello
---
---
 fn main() is the entry point of the program. The println! macro prints text to the console.<br>
 The exclamation mark indicates that println! is a macro, not a function.<br>
 The semicolon at the end of the line indicates the end of a statement in Rust.<br>
 To run this program, save it in a file named hello.rs and use the command `rustc hello.rs` to compile it.<br>   
 After compilation, run the generated executable to see the output `.\hello.exe`. <br>
 This is a simple program that demonstrates the basic syntax of Rust.<br>
 It shows how to define a main function, print text to the console, and use comments. <br>
 The program is a simple "Hello, World!" example, which is often the first program written in a new programming language.<br>
 This program is a simple demonstration of Rust's syntax and structure.<br>
