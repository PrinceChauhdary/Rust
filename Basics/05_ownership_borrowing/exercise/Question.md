# 🏰 Rust Adventure: Mastering Ownership & Borrowing 🏰

## 📖 Introduction
Rust ensures **memory safety** without a garbage collector through **ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes**. Understanding these concepts is crucial to mastering Rust!

Ownership follows **three rules**:
1. Each value has a **single owner**.
2. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is **dropped**.
3. Ownership can be **moved** or **borrowed**.

Let's embark on a **story-driven journey** to understand these concepts! 🚀

## ⚔️ Quest 1: The Sword of Ownership 🗡

You are a knight who found an **ancient sword**. However, Rustoria’s magic allows only **one owner** per sword!

🔹 **Challenge:**
- Create a `String` variable `sword`.
- Move ownership of `sword` to a function `use_sword()`.
- Try using `sword` again (and see what happens!).

💡 **Hint:** Ownership moves when passing a variable to a function!

## 🏰 Quest 2: The Scroll of Borrowing 📜

The **Royal Librarian** has a powerful scroll but won’t give it away. Instead, you can **borrow** it to read!

🔹 **Challenge:**
- Create a function `read_scroll(scroll: &String)` that **borrows** a scroll.
- Pass a `String` scroll without transferring ownership.
- Try using the `scroll` again after the function call.

💡 **Hint:** Use `&` to borrow without losing ownership!

## 🧙‍♂️ Quest 3: The Wizard’s Mutability Curse 🔮

A wizard curses you! Your health **cannot be changed** unless you use the power of **mutable references**.

🔹 **Challenge:**
- Create a function `heal(health: &mut i32)`.
- Pass a mutable reference and increase the value.
- Try modifying `health` inside the function.

💡 **Hint:** Use `&mut` for mutable borrowing!

---

## 🏕️ Quest 4: The Tavern’s Borrowing Rule 🍺

The Rustoria Tavern allows **only one mutable borrower OR multiple immutable borrowers**, never both at once!

🔹 **Challenge:**
- Create an `inventory` String.
- Borrow it **immutably twice**.
- Try borrowing it **mutably** at the same time (and see the error!).

💡 **Hint:** Rust enforces borrowing rules to prevent data races!

## ⚖️ Quest 5: The Guardian of Lifetimes ⏳

A legendary **Guardian of Time** only allows variables with valid **lifetimes** to pass through.

🔹 **Challenge:**
- Create two string slices.
- Write a function `longest(a: &str, b: &str) -> &str` that returns the longest string.
- Try compiling it without specifying lifetimes (`'a`), and see the error!

💡 **Hint:** Use **lifetimes (`'a`)** to define how long references live!

---

## 🎯 Final Challenge: The Rust Knight’s Journey ⚔️

Combine all these concepts to write a **Rust adventure game** where:
- The hero has a **weapon (ownership)**.
- Can **inspect** their **armor (borrowing)**.
- Can **repair** a **shield (mutable borrowing)**.
- Cannot break Rust's **borrowing rules**!

Write functions that interact with your hero’s equipment using ownership and borrowing!
